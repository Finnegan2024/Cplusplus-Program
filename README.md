# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I was tasked with developing a banking application that allowed users to input their investments and calculate how much their investments will earn over over a particular stretch of years via compound interest. The application was object oriented which meant I had to utilize
classes within C++. The application would return two reports; one without monthly investments that would return the compound interest and total earned; the second with monthly investments that would return the compound interest and total earned. Users were able to change their
initial investment amount, monthly investment amount, annual interest(compounded monthly), and number of years they would like to calculate their investment. Each change would generate two new reports for the user.

#What did you do particularly well?
I did a fair job of maintaining a neat and short main function by utilizng class member functions and switch cases that kept all data within the bank class of the application. I also focused on input validation to ensure the application would run as smoothly as possible with little to no errors or crashes.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If I utilized pointers and pass by reference paramaters within the class, I believe the code would be more efficient and secure. However, at the time the project was due, I was still unaware of how to properly use pointers and pass by reference paramaters. It wasn't until module 7 that I felt more confident in my ability with both.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the member function that would calculate the interest over time with monthly investments was difficult to create. However, I utilized C++ documentation and forums to understand why certain aspects of C++ work the way they do which allowed me to overcome my obstacles.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I enjoyed learning and utilizing the idea of pointers. Especially after learning how useful they are with programmer created classess and I definitely see the potential for utilizing pointers in other courses and projects moving forward.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable because I separated the application into three files. Each file can be manipulated while minimizing its effects on the other two files which will allow other programmers to read, maintain, and update my code easily and efficiently.
